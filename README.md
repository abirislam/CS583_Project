# CS583 Scanner Application Project

### How To Run Program
- To run this program simply hit run within Matlab, or use the commandline to run project.m
- When prompted, enter the filename of the image you'd like to process with quotes, and including file extension like so: "test_image.jpg"
- Two example images have been provided for you to test, namely test_image.jpg and test_image2.jpg

### Additional Features
- The program will run multiple times to iteratively find the best edge detection threshold for the image that produces 4 corners
- Thus it may take some time for the program to run
- It will output the threshold and number of corners in each iteration
- Once it determines the best threshold, it will then produce the rectified image
